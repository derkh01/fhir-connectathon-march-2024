# Ring of FHIR - Connectathon March 2024

This is the repo for the NEMS / Questionnaire stream for the Ring Of FHIR Connectathon. There are 2 simple subscriber applications written in Java and .NET. Depending on your comfort level you can choose the language of your choice. However the Java client application has more helper files to manage FHIR requests.

If you are a .NET enthusiast we encourage you to use the .NET example and build out the FHIR capability.

It is assumed that you have a level of developer experience, e.g. you know how to run a Java or .NET program from your PC. The sample code should be easy enough to install and run on your PC with no code changes.
